# About Us

## Who are we?

We’re a little game company based out of scenic Boulder, CO. We make tabletop
role-playing games, particularly games in the post-Forge indie-RPG tradition.
Sadly, this isn’t our day-job, but we do love it and want to get back to you.

## W. Austin Bookheimer

A philosopher and nocturnalist, sometimes gentleman thief. Austin enjoys long
walks on Titan&nbsp;VII’s methane-snow-covered beaches, and bonfire-lit dinners
with the Maenads on the mountain. Given the choice between magic and
cybernetics, he would choose cybernetics. When he tweets, it’s
[@AugustAlso](http://twitter.com/AugustAlso).

## Kit La Touche

A webdeveloper and Pythonista, sometimes psychopomp. Kit enjoys editing and
typography, the weird phenomena to be observed in human languages, and wrecking
ships on rocky beaches. He’s also responsible for maintaining the server where
this is hosted. As such, his personal blog can be found
[here](http://transneptune.net/blog/). He tweets a lot
[@wlonk](http://twitter.com/wlonk).

## John LeBoeuf-Little

A programmer and climber, sometimes master strategist. John has coded in Java,
C#, C++, and plenty of obscure languages besides. His favorite strategy game is
Go; his least favorite game is Candy Land. He tweets just enough

## Allie McCarthy

An artist and writer, sometimes ifrit. She can be found on Twitter
[@SpacePlesiosaur](http://twitter.com/SpacePlesiosaur).

And finally, many thanks to [Cat McCarthy](http://catmccarthy.com/) for our
wonderful logo!
