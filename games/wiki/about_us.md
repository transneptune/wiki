About Us
========

Who are we?
-----------

We’re a little game company based out of scenic Boulder, CO. We make tabletop role-playing games, particularly games in the indie-RPG game tradition, or story-games, as they’re called by some. Sadly, this isn’t our day-job, but we do love it and want to get back to you.

W. Austin Bookheimer
--------------------

A philosopher and cook, sometimes gentleman thief. Austin enjoys long walks on Titan VII’s methane-snow-covered beaches, and bonfire-lit dinners with the Maenads on the mountain. Given the choice between magic and cybernetics, he would choose cybernetics. When he tweets, it’s [@AugustAlso](http://twitter.com/AugustAlso).

Kit La Touche
-------------

A webdeveloper and Pythonista, sometimes werebear. Kit enjoys editing and typography, the weird phenomena to be observed in human languages, and wrecking ships on rocky beaches. He’s also responsible for maintaining the server where this is hosted. As such, his personal blog can be found [here](http://transneptune.net/blog/). He tweets a lot [@wlonk](http://twitter.com/wlonk).

John LeBoeuf-Little
-------------------

A programmer and climber, sometimes master strategist. John has coded in Java, C#, C++, and plenty of obscure languages besides. His favorite strategy game is Go; his least favorite game is Candy Land. He tweets just enough [@worldnamer](http://twitter.com/worldnamer).

Allie McCarthy
--------------

An artist and writer, sometimes ifrit. She can be found on Twitter [@HawleyQuinn](http://twitter.com/HawleyQuinn).

And finally, many thanks to [Cat McCarthy](http://catmccarthy.com/) for our wonderful logo!
