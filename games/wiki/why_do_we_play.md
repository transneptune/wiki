Why Do We Play?
===============

The simple (simplistic?) answer is "for fun". But I think that there's a lot
more to play than that.

I, Kit, look back at the best games I've played, the high points in my
experience of gaming, and I find that there's something consistent. There's
emotional impact in the moment of play, there's feeling something hard or
harsh or harrowing, possibly coupled with release and relief afterwards, or
not.

Then there's the post-game dissection. Seeing why the character did what they
did, and why *we* ourselves did what we did. Sometimes, it's clear, and it
just takes a look between the people involved to understand. Sometimes, it's
more complicated, and you need a post-game post-mortem to see what people were
doing and why.

These are games about stories, sure, but they're also games about acting.
About putting on, OH NO I SAID IT, *roles*. I think you can see a lot about
yourself through pretending to be someone else.

That's fun.
