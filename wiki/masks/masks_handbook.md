# Masks Handbook

## What is this?

*Masks: a New Generation* is quite possibly my favorite RPG to take out
on short notice, and definitely hands-down my favorite superhero RPG.
That's because it's not just about superheroes, but also about teens
coming to understand themselves, their powers, and the world that needs
them.

I've run and played *Masks* a lot, but I'm not going to pretend that I
have all the answers, or the guide to the One True Way of running or
playing *Masks*. This is just my take on what works for me. I hope it'll
be useful and inspirational for you, but in the end, you do you---as
long as everyone at your table is jamming, it's working.

So follow me on a journey, as I wax poetic about a really great game.

If you want the short summary, I've got one
[here](/masks/starting_masks).

## The dial and media references

Superhero media is diverse, at least tonally. There are so many kinds of
stories to tell and so many ways to tell them, folks can easily come to
the table with some deeply divergent ideas. I've seen this at my table,
and for a one-shot, it's usually easy to incorporate a Legacy of Lilith
and an Outsider whose culture's names all come from terms in audiology
pretty OK---as long as everyone agrees on some core tonal points, like
life has value and this isn't some grimdark Image Comics superhero game.

Though maybe it's not fair of me to single out Image as though they only
did *Spawn*---they also published *Flaming Carrot*, and I think that
those two actually define a really useful spectrum, or dial. On one end
is *Flaming Carrot* and *The Tick*, and on the other is *Spawn* and *The
Punisher*. I think, for me, *Masks* lives somewhere in-between, with
*Young Justice*, *Strong Female Protagonist*, *Cleverman*, *Hellboy*,
and *Runaways*. Stories that are not absurdist, but can be funny; not
grimdark, but can be serious; and that center young (or at least,
immature) people trying to deal with the expectations the world has for
them. But you can move things more towards one end or the other, if you
and everyone you're playing with agree.

Those are my media touchstones. What are yours?

## Starting the game

*Apocalypse World* says to start by following your characters around,
living their daily life. Don't do that here---start with a **fight**. At
the end of prep, they're a team who has fought together before, and has
reasons to do so again. Give them a chance to show off, to open with a
bang. Odds are this opening villain will also give many hooks for future
trouble, and all you have to do is listen to the players' theories and
run with them.

But maybe *just* a fight is hard---the best action scenes contextualize
and show off character, after all. So, also start with
**relationships**---let the opening show who hangs out with who, who
freaks out when who is in danger, who wants to show off for who. As the
GM, any time you're not sure which move to pick, pick the one that puts
pressure on the relationship you're curious about.

Finally, also start with a **reason**. It's usually the case in *Masks*
that there are adult superheroes around, who you would think would be
better-suited to stopping supervillains. So *why these kids*? I've seen
reasons from official sanction (the Protégé's mentor wants a team who
no-one will suspect!) to the absence of competent adults, to "fuck the
grown-ups, they're in on it, don't trust anyone over 30", to a very
personal and immediate need to get the villain who harmed you.

The team doesn't have to all agree, by the way. But they should at least
know and understand each others' reasons. They are, after all, a *team*.
And the *players* should totally be on board---be explicit about this
conversation during set-up.

## Two things to remember as GM

There are two things that I think are buried in the GM rules a bit that
I want to flag.

*Masks*, p136, "Make a move when...":

> You make a move---as hard or as soft as you like---when:\
> ... there's a lull in the conversation.\
> ... a player misses a roll.\
> ... a player hands you a golden opportunity.

*Masks*, p155, "Villains":

> Villain is a catch-all term for the main antagonists in your story.
> Sometimes villains are straight-up monsters; other times, they have
> all too human motivations. You might even have a "villain" who's
> actually one of the city's biggest heroes! A villain is simply an NPC
> important enough---and threatening enough---to get an in-depth workup
> as an antagonist in your game.

## One-shots

If I'm honest with myself, I've never run or played in a one-shot of
*Masks* that I didn't want to see spin out into a long-running game
where I could fully explore the characters and get to know them.
One-shots are teasers for a show you'll probably never get to see. They
are, in a sense, the one that got away. So love them, but you *have* to
let them go. This leaves you free to turn everything up to
eleven---don't hold back, don't wait for the big reveal. Just get
everyone on a page and go for it. Things can be as full of shorthand and
tropes as you want---you won't have time to really earn your payoffs, so
don't worry about it.

Start with a tight relationship web, ratchet that tension up, then throw
them into a fight so they can't resolve the relationship tension yet.
Give them downtime with a dash of team time and a dash of regular
lives---as the characters and playbooks call for---and then build
towards a big finale fight. If you have time, get a little dénouement,
over shawarma or similar, and see if you got to hit all the basic,
influence, and team moves. That should be good. It's just a taste, try a
little of everything.

## Long-term games

You can start with the above, but in a long-term game, you'll want and
need a bit more to keep things going and to help them get a little
deeper. The best and the brightest of these tools are Arcs and Hooks,
from page 181 in the core book.

Use them. Seriously. Go back and re-read that chapter. Hooks keep your
PCs under dynamic tension, and Arcs make sure they're a little too busy
to focus on resolving their personal issues. (Sound like high school?
Yeah.) Lovingly hand-craft your hooks for each PC, making sure each has
NPCs who care about them enough to want to pull them towards different
labels.

For your arcs, refer back to the team's reason for superheroing---by the
end of the arc, maybe that reason has gotten bigger than it started, but
hopefully they've grown enough that it's still about *them* resolving
things, not the adults. An arc, also remember, is not an outline of
acts. It is, or should be, something the PCs derail. It's an evil plan,
it's what will happen if the PCs disengage or do nothing or fail. It is,
in a word, a threat.

So, between sessions, go back and look at your arcs. See how the PCs'
actions have changed things and think about how villainous plans will
adjust. This isn't a zero-prep game where you show up each week without
having given it any thought in the intervening time. Your prep involves
adjusting arcs, spotting who has been acting off-screen, moving plans
and deeds around, and making new villains to face. It's low-effort and
should be fun for you, but it's there. Schedule it, if that helps you.

One more thing---tracking influence between sessions can be a weirdly
painful logistical matter. I've made some sheets I find helpful. Check
them out [here](https://tinyurl.com/Masks-RPG-Tools).

## Feeling like a comic book

*Masks* works best when it draws on comics. Yeah, superheroes and
superheroics exist in a lot of media these days, with the Big Two
pushing out a lot of things for the screen right now especially. But
superheroes' roots are forever in comics, and comics have a distinct
character that is worth drawing (heh) on.

So go read Scott McCloud's *Understanding Comics*. I'll wait.

Read it? OK. Obviously, RPGs are a verbal, unedited medium while comics
are a visual, edited medium, so you can't just take techniques
one-for-one. But you can adapt! It's not uncommon in RPG play to borrow
terminology and concepts from film: we'll talk about "there's a close
up" or "smash cut to" or "and the camera's doing that thing where it
spins around me but like I'm spinning at a slower rate". Try this with
comics: "There's a panel of us just rushing down the street in extreme
hyper-stylized perspective, like distorting the distance" or "full page
spread of you just socking the villain in the face with the letters K-O!
big behind the two of you" or (one of my favorites) "You reach out and
your arm goes past the frame of the panel into the gutter, and you step
through and you're just *in the space between panels* now."

That's the language, the way of envisioning what's going on. You can
also do this for things like lettering: instead of imitating the voice
of the universal embodiment of dreams, you can say something like "they
speak in white lettering in jagged black speech bubbles."

Of course you don't have to do this 100% of the time. But doing it more
than none is really good.

What about pacing? Superhero comics have a pacing entirely unlike a lot
of other media we consume. There's a rhythm imposed by the physical
format and frequency of publishing, and the serialized format. It's not
the same as for a tabletop game, again, so don't copy one-to-one. But
it's similar, and it's kinda cool to use it: it often dives in without a
lot of exposition (you don't have the page count! Put what you can into
the background art!) and has a pretty quick rising action. But then you
can have a whole issue that focuses on the emotional dynamic between two
characters, even just one really meaty conversation. But regardless, it
still might not spend a lot of time showing how the characters get to
the situation, rather trusting the reader to accept it.

There are other comics styles, of course, and variation coming from
comics intended for trade paperback or graphic novel publication, but
what I really want to do here is give you permission to be clear, quick,
and concise in your setting up of a situation, and know that it'll work
for *Masks*.

## The moves

*Masks* has a lot of moves. If your players are old hands, it's fine,
just play and let the moves happen where they happen. But if anyone at
your table is new to *Masks*, it's good to have a plan for teaching the
moves.

Breaking them into sections helps: basic, playbook, influence, team. In
session one, you want to:

- ensure everyone gets to use a move or two,
- each basic move gets used (all eight; that's two per player in a
  prototypical four player game),
- a few playbook moves are used,
- and there's at least one moment of someone *telling someone who they
  are and how the world works*.

"Take a powerful blow" is on you as the MC to call for; no one is gonna
leap to do it themselves. And "defend" is an interesting one; people
often miss opportunities to do it, but if you ask that delicious MC
question "What do you do?" of someone not directly toe-to-toe with the
villain, and make it clear there are people in need of protection
around, you'll get characters leaping to Defend. It's good.

Team moves... well, the only one you need in session one is "when you go
into a fight". The vulnerability and celebration and stuff team moves
can be in later sessions. Tell people "There are a lot of moves. Let's
start by checking out the basic moves, and I'll help you bring in more
as we play."

A great way to make this happen is to open with a fight, with a
throwaway villain, followed by downbeats about the team and the people
affected by the fight. (Throwaway villains often can come back, or be
part of some larger conspiracy, but don't worry about that yet.)

Influence moves: "who you are and how the world works" and "take +1 on
moves targeting someone over whom you have influence" will be in session
one. Nothing else will, probably. That's OK.

Moments of Truth! Don't even worry about those in session one! I think
that they're usually unearned if they happen that early. But someone'll
ask about them and you can say "those are part of long-term play; I hope
we'll get to see some used!"

## Reveals and escalations

*Masks* isn't a mystery game, and yet in game after game that I run,
play in, or watch, there are characters finding clues, uncovering hidden
agendas, and doing things that, on the surface, feel like the sorts of
things you'd do in a mystery. But this is kind of a trap, or at least a
thing to approach with extreme caution.

*Don't* make people roll to find out key pieces of information---this is
often dangerous in RPGs anyway, but especially in a game like this.
*Maybe* there are rolls involved that answer questions like "what does
it cost you to find this out" or "have you found out with enough time to
do something about it, or at the last minute and you have to
scramble---or find a way to time travel?"

What I find works best is this: instead of thinking about clues, think
about *reveals*. These don't have to be a villain monologuing, though
that's okay too. Fundamentally, these are *unambiguous evidence*, like
"you step into the underground lab full of psychically controlled clones
of the city's elite". Note, though, that they need not explain the
*whole* plan---just the next step. Basically, "what's next on the Arc
the GM planned?"

Put another way: signal the escalations of the arc before you get there,
but do so with flair. Let the players strive to stop that escalation,
and if they don't---make it. Do it. Escalate it. If they can put
together from a few reveals what the ultimate goal is, *that's fine*.
Sometimes, the heroes figure out what the villain's planning. But don't
*expect* them to or rely on it. And also, don't pull it out from
them---just because the heroes understand the villain's goal, that
doesn't mean it'll be trivial to stop it.

## Scope

You ever notice how every superhero is out there saving the world all
the time? And you ever notice how that doesn't always feel *earned*? How
do you target scope in a game of *Masks*?

I feel like the big scope, the world-saving scope, is something you
build up to. In *Masks* in particular, you have to have an answer to the
question of why these characters are doing the hard work, instead of
letting the adults, the full-time heroes, the people who understand
their own powers and have navigated the hard things before handle it.
That means that you need to reel them in, you need to get them involved,
invested, and implicated before you show the full scale of whatever the
problem is. This is a coming-of-age story as well as a superhero story,
and that means you need to give the characters a chance to grow into
what they would have rejected at the outset.

Of course, you can show something big at the outset, but know that
they'll probably reject it, and have a plan for how and why that's
*okay*. You've gotta earn a big scope, and the details of it will
surprise you if you get there the long way.

But also: you don't have to go for a big scope! If you're gonna do it,
you have to earn it, but you don't *have to do it*. Smaller stories have
tons of value, and a magical thing about tabletop RPGs is that you get
to constantly check in with your players about what stakes matter to
them. Part of the reason superhero movies, especially, focus on
world-saving is that it's a cheap and quick way to say to everyone in
the audience: "this matters". But It's far from the only thing that
*can* matter.

## The team

There are some important things to think about and answer concerning the
main characters' team. Many of them are facilitated by the "when our
team first came together" and backstory questions, but they still
warrant some consideration.

So, *why this team*? Why do this bunch of kids---not the most
experienced or powerful superheroes in the setting, most likely---step
up and stop this villain? Why do they do so *together*? How do they even
know what's going on enough to get mixed up in it? You don't need *one*
answer to each of these, also. You probably need to continually answer
and re-answer these as you go, considering the characters' situation as
it evolves.

> fight supervillains, you're still gonna be on the team. So why do you
> care about *the team*?"

The next tier of questions about the team concerns how the members of
the team interact and feel about each other. Obviously, this is a
continual question, too. I like to approach it by thinking not just
about screen time that each character gets, but screen time for each
*relationship* in the team. If a team consists of four characters,
that's six dyadic relationships to give screen time to---not too bad,
really! Just make sure that there are chances for each pair to work out
together, hang out together, and find surprising connections with each
other. When you ask a player "who are you doing that with?" and they say
"You know, Zero Point and I haven't gotten to do a lot together yet..."
you know that they're helping you with this.

Corley adds:

> Masks GMing, at its throw-away-the-playbooks core, is an "OH YEAH?!?
> How about NOW?!" game. Sometimes you get a Transformed who says "I
> think I'm okay with my monster body?" and the GM's job is to say "Oh
> yeah? Your crush jumps in fear when you turn the corner unexpectedly.
> The local authorities are talking about locking 'things' like you up.
> You're becoming contagious to other people around you. Your sainted
> grandma wants to do an exorcism. Here's a supervillain who wants to
> purify the city. Here's another who wants to make everyone in the city
> like you. HOW ABOUT NOW?! YOU LIKE IT NOW???" And if the Transformed

> you're a real hero because you rescued that family. HOW DO YOU FEEL
> NOW?!? HUH?? HUH??" You do this for all issues of all character
> forever because that's teenage hood.

This is good stuff, but I want you to particularly think about it as it
relates to the team and the relationships inside the team.

## Good villains, bad villains, and villains in between

"Villains", especially in *Masks*, are not always pursuing *eeeevil*.
The core book talks about this, I've talked about it already, but I want
to underline it here. *Masks* villains need reasons for what they're
doing, and those reasons should have at least a hair more complexity
than "because eeeevil!" even if those reasons still don't leave room for
negotiation. No one cares about a Snidely Whiplash villain, one who just
does evil to be bad.

If you look at recent Marvel Cinematic Universe stuff, they've been
trying to do a lot of this, with mixed success. You want your villains
to have reasons, and you want them ideally to be reasons the players and
characters can understand, maybe even engage with, but you do also want
their actions to be *wrong*. You have a chance, in *Masks*, to break out
of the recurring conservatism of superhero stories, their tendency to
view the *status quo* as good and worthy of preserving at all costs.

The best villains, though, go one step further. The best villains push
precisely on the emotional soft spots of the characters. The best
villains have reasons that leave the heroes feeling like they are *in
this picture* and they *do not like it*. What's really great is when the
villain's reasons make some of the team feel like maybe the villain has
kind of a point and others in the group feel like they have to stop that
villain at all costs. A villain acting as a wedge issue gives you a
chance to have a good villain, have a good fight, *and* spotlight a
relationship dynamic. It's a delight!

As one final note here, if you have any of the Delinquent, the Reformed,
or the Scion---or in some cases, also, the Doomed---in your team, they
might have a particularly close and complex relationship with some
villains. Be prepared for them to align more strongly for *or* against
any villain, and have fun with that!

## In conclusion

*Masks* is a lot of fun, but/and has a lot of moving parts. I say "but"
because it can feel overwhelming, and like the bar is very high for
getting everything right. I say "and" because all those moving parts
*let* you get a better result when they are all working, and directly
contribute to the fun of it.

Don't feel like you have to do everything in this at once, or even ever.
Like everything else, this is about practice, and knowing what tools are
available to you, and maybe offering a few tips for how to make those
tools shine. Your influences and aesthetics aren't mine, and you'll make
the game your own, and your players will *love* it.
