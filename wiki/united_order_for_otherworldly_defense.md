# The United Order for Otherworldly Defense

So picture this: it's like a [West Marches game][1], but not adventurers in a
fantasy land. Rather, you are all agents of various different organizations
dedicated to defending humanity from otherworldly threats, bound in a tenuous
alliance. There are a few entities (the Templars, etc) that have a permanent
seat on the security council, and then innumerable smaller other organizations.
Whichever characters end up on a mission are selected based on impenetrable
internal politics and constrained availability.

Each week, or whatever the cadence is, the GMs can put together a list of
global hotspots where _something_ is happening, and the players can organize
themselves about which one to investigate. Gradually, these events can reveal
larger themes, but they can also just be episodic.

The agents can be members of the major entities, or of smaller ones that the
player makes up. They can be "normal", or "enhanced ability" agents. Maybe
design this with Cortex Prime? Would that handle _enough_ progression?

As per West Marches, participants should write up after-action reports, and
they can be posted and shared in the organization's archives.

Probably set this in the late 20s? Colonialist problems, rise of Nazis doing
ill-advised supernatural shit as clear enemies, capitalist/communist tensions.
Lots of options.
