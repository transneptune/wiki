# About Us

## Who are we?

We’re a little game collective based out of scenic Boulder, CO. We make
tabletop role-playing games. Sadly, this isn’t our day-job, but we do love it
and want to get back to you. So get in touch with us!

## How to reach us

The best ways are probably via Twitter, G+, or [our contact
form](https://transneptunegames.com/contact/).

A philosopher and nocturnalist, sometimes gentleman thief. Austin enjoys long
walks on Titan&nbsp;VII’s methane-snow-covered beaches, and bonfire-lit dinners
with the Maenads on the mountain. Given the choice between magic and
cybernetics, he would choose cybernetics. When he tweets, it’s

ships on rocky beaches. He’s also responsible for maintaining the server where
this is hosted. As such, his personal blog can be found
